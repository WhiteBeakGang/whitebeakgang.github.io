- Passwords get compromised all the time and networks are not always secure
- 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an additional layer of security when accessing apps/services online
- When 2FA is enabled, you will need to approve requests using a pin/code/push from a third party application
- Having 2 layers of security helps prevent your accounts and assets from being compromised if your credentials are exposed
