- Security is a team effort requiring us all to be diligent about identifying, addressing, and informing others as to potential security risks
- Never click links you don't recognize and always double check links you do recognize to ensure the destination address is fully correct
- Always verify the person messaging you in your DMs is the person you think it is and not an impostor pretending to be someone else
- Keep your device software up to date to prevent security vulnerabilities from being exploited
- Never leave your device unattended to avoid physical compromise of your systems
