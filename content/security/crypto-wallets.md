- Software wallets such as Metamask and Coinbase Wallet exist as programs/browser extensions on your devices and often are partly custodied with a third party
- Hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor run on physical devices with your private keys stored on the device instead of your connected devices or online
- Connecting a hardware wallet to a software wallet like Metamask allows the hardware wallet to be used as a 2FA device requiring you to approve transactions both in the software and on the physical device
- Using the combination of a Software and Hardware wallet allows you to conveniently access your favorite dApps without compromising on security
