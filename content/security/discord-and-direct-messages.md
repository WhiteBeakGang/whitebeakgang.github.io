- Discord is one of the most popular platforms for Blockchain, Crypto, and NFTs.
- Many Discord integrations prompt you to connect metamask or enter some other potentially sensitive information.
- It's important to be cautious when using this platform and clicking links or interacting with bots.
- Direct Messages containing spammy and potentially malicious links are common and must be treated appropriately.
- Always verify Direct Messages you receive are truly from the person you think and not someone posing as a trusted individual.
