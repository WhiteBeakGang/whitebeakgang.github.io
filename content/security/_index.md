## Passwords

- Avoid using public/shared networks if possible.
- If a public/shared network must be used, make sure you have a VPN set up to keep you safe.
- VPNs will encrypt your traffic and prevent others from intercepting your requests or seeing your data.

## 2 Factor Authentication

![2FA](/images/security/2-factor-authentication.jpeg "2FA")

- Passwords get compromised all the time and networks are not always secure
- 2 Factor Authentication (2FA) adds an additional layer of security when accessing apps/services online
- When 2FA is enabled, you will need to approve requests using a pin/code/push from a third party application
- Having 2 layers of security helps prevent your accounts and assets from being compromised if your credentials are exposed

## Phishing and Social Engineering

![Phishing](/images/security/phishing.png "Phishing")

- Social Engineering is the practice of using someone's natural behaviors and tendencies against them
- Social Engineering is often employed to get the target individual to reveal/disclose sensitive information they otherwise would not share
- Phishing uses Social Engineering techniques to get a target to provide access to account credentials
- Phishing attacks can be very sophisticated and clever in their design requiring you to be aware of these risks and to be on the lookout for suspicious clues and red flags

## Keyloggers and Malware

![Keyloggers](/images/security/keyloggers-and-malware.png "Keyloggers")

- Software designed for a malicous purpose is referred to as Malware
- Malware comes in many forms and may infect your devices in different ways
- Keyloggers are a type of malware that monitor your typing and record keystrokes being sent to your keyboard
- This data can be sent to other servers to people looking to abuse this info (credit cards, passwords, contacts, recovery seeds)

## Software and Hardware Wallets

![Software and Hardware Wallets](/images/security/software-and-hardware-wallets.jpeg "Software and Hardware Wallets")

- Software wallets such as Metamask and Coinbase Wallet exist as programs/browser extensions on your devices and often are partly custodied with a third party
- Hardware wallets like Ledger and Trezor run on physical devices with your private keys stored on the device instead of your connected devices or online
- Connecting a hardware wallet to a software wallet like Metamask allows the hardware wallet to be used as a 2FA device requiring you to approve transactions both in the software and on the physical device
- Using the combination of a Software and Hardware wallet allows you to conveniently access your favorite dApps without compromising on security

## Best Practices

![Best Practices](/images/security/best-practices.jpeg "Best Practices")

- Security is a team effort requiring us all to be diligent about identifying, addressing, and informing others as to potential security risks
- Never click links you don't recognize and always double check links you do recognize to ensure the destination address is fully correct
- Always verify the person messaging you in your DMs is the person you think it is and not an impostor pretending to be someone else
- Keep your device software up to date to prevent security vulnerabilities from being exploited
- Never leave your device unattended to avoid physical compromise of your systems
