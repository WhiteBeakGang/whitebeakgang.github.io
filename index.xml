These may sometimes be accidentally introduced through inexperienced or careless developers or intentially by more malicious parties. A malicious smart contract may attempt to trick you into paying an exorbitant amount of crypto to the contract/address or transfer your other assets/NFTs against your will. Enabling 2 Factor and using a Hardware Wallet are critical steps to prevent being vulnerable to these exploits.</description></item><item><title>Passwords</title><link>https://whitebeakgang.com/security/passwords/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whitebeakgang.com/security/passwords/</guid><description>Keep your passwords safe and secure. Make sure you are not reusing passwords across many sites. Utilize a password manager to generate and keep track of hard to remember passwords for more security.

These airdropped NFTs tend to be scams and are involved in a variety of attacks. A dusting attack will track wallets that attempt to spend or sell these assets which allows the trackers to deanonymize wallet addresses and better social engineer them. Potentially malicious smart contracts may also be connected to these NFTs that will prompt you to transfer crypto and other assets out of your wallet when attempting to sell or transfer the airdropped NFT.</description></item><item><title>Scams</title><link>https://whitebeakgang.com/security/scams/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whitebeakgang.com/security/scams/</guid><description>As with any potentially profitable field, there are many scammers in the Crypto, Blockchain, and NFT space. If an offer sounds too good to be true, it generally is too good to be true and should be approached with extreme skepticism. Always check with other trusted communities when presented with something that seems like a scam. Scams are only effective when the targets don&amp;rsquo;t know what to be on the lookout for.</description></item><item><title>Snacks are on us!</title><link>https://whitebeakgang.com/roadmap/wbg-snacks/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://whitebeakgang.com/roadmap/wbg-snacks/</guid><description>Date Status September 4th 2021 Complete We work long and Play hard.
